# Avatar CDN Repository

This repository contains avatar images for use via CDN delivery. You can use the images in the `cartoon-avatars/` and `uifaces-avatars/` folders directly in your projects.

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-username>/<repo-name>@main/cartoon-avatars/1.jpg
```

Replace `<your-username>` and `<repo-name>` with your GitHub username and repository name.

## Folders
- `cartoon-avatars/` — Cartoon style avatars
- `uifaces-avatars/` — UI faces avatars

## Excluded Files
